### Accurate Tracking

- **Weigh your food**: Use a kitchen scale for accurate measurements

- **Be specific**: Use descriptive meal names to track eating patterns

### Using the Database

- **Standard portions**: Database values are per 100g for foods and per 100ml for drinks
- **Common measurements**:
  - 1 cup of rice (cooked) ‚âà 150-200g
  - 1 chicken breast ‚âà 150-200g
  - 1 can of soda ‚âà 330ml
  - 1 glass of wine ‚âà 150ml
  - 1 beer (bottle/can) ‚âà 330-355ml

### Custom Foods

If a food isn't in the database:
1. Type the name anyway
2. Manually enter the nutrition values from the product label
3. The app will remember your entry for that meal

## Understanding Your Data

### Macronutrients

- **Carbohydrates**: Primary energy source (4 calories per gram)
- **Protein**: Building blocks for muscles and tissues (4 calories per gram)
- **Fats**: Not currently tracked (9 calories per gram)

### Calorie Tracking

The app tracks total calories, which come from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Note that the app's calorie calculations may not account for all fat content, as only carbs and protein are explicitly tracked.

### Daily Goals (Not Built-In)

The app doesn't set goals, but common guidelines:
- **Average adult**: 2000-2500 calories/day
- **Protein**: 0.8-1.0g per kg of body weight
- **Carbohydrates**: 45-65% of total calories

Consult a nutritionist for personalized recommendations.

## Data & Privacy

- **No cloud sync**: Data is not transmitted or stored externally
- **Data persistence**: Data is saved using iOS UserDefaults

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't find a food/drink
**Solution**: Type the full name or a close match. If still not found, enter manually.

### Issue: Wrong nutrition values after selecting from database
**Solution**: Adjust the weight/volume first, then values will recalculate. Or manually edit the values.

### Issue: Meal won't save
**Solution**: Ensure meal has a name and at least one food or drink item.
