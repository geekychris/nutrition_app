# Summary of Changes: CSV Data Integration

## What Was Changed

The NutritionTracker application has been updated to load food nutrition data from CSV files instead of using hardcoded arrays.

## Key Changes

### NutritionDatabase.swift
**Before:** Hardcoded array of ~40 food items
**After:** Dynamically loads 2,395 food items from CSV files

### Implementation Details

1. **Dynamic Loading**
   - Added `init()` method to load CSV data on startup
   - Implemented `loadFoodsFromCSV()` to read and parse all 5 CSV files
   - Added intelligent path resolution for both development and production builds

2. **CSV Parsing**
   - Custom `parseCSVRow()` handles quoted fields correctly
   - Extracts: Food name, Calories, Carbohydrates, Protein (per 100g)

3. **Automatic Categorization**
   - Foods are categorized based on name patterns and nutritional content
   - Categories: Protein, Carbs, Fruits, Vegetables, Dairy, Nuts, Other

4. **Fallback System**
   - Original hardcoded foods retained as fallback data
   - App works even if CSV files cannot be loaded

## Data Sources

**CSV Files in `dataset/` directory:**
- FOOD-DATA-GROUP1.csv → 551 foods
- FOOD-DATA-GROUP2.csv → 319 foods  
- FOOD-DATA-GROUP3.csv → 571 foods
- FOOD-DATA-GROUP4.csv → 232 foods
- FOOD-DATA-GROUP5.csv → 722 foods
- **Total: 2,395 foods**

**Drinks:** Remain hardcoded (20+ drink templates)

## Testing Results

✅ **Build Status:** Successful compilation with no errors  
✅ **CSV Loading:** All 2,395 foods loaded successfully  
✅ **Path Resolution:** Works in development environment  
✅ **Backward Compatibility:** Maintains all existing functionality  
✅ **Food Search:** Works correctly with new dataset  

## Next Steps

To use in production builds:
1. Add `dataset` folder to Xcode project as folder reference (see ADD_DATASET_TO_XCODE.md)
2. Verify CSV files are included in app bundle
3. Test on device/simulator to confirm "Successfully loaded 2395 foods" message

## Files Modified

- `NutritionTracker/NutritionDatabase.swift` - Complete rewrite of food loading logic

## Files Created

- `CSV_INTEGRATION.md` - Technical documentation
- `ADD_DATASET_TO_XCODE.md` - Xcode setup instructions  
- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - This file
- `test_csv_loading.swift` - Verification script

## Impact

**Before:** Limited food database with ~40 items  
**After:** Comprehensive food database with 2,395 items

Users can now:
- Search from 60x more food options
- Find more specific foods (e.g., multiple cheese varieties)
- Get accurate nutrition data from a larger dataset
- Experience better food suggestions and autocomplete
